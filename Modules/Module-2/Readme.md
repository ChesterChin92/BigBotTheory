# Publishing Our Bot

## Welcome to Module 2!

If you have completed  [Module 1](https://github.com/DanyStinson/BigBotTheory/tree/master/Modules/Module-1) you should have a working basic bot.

Here is a small resume of what this module is going to cover:

- Publish the bot as an Azure WebApp
- Register our bot in Bot Framework
- Deploy our bot in a Skype Account

### Publishing our bot in Azure 

Publishing a web application is very easy, simple and fast with Visual Studio and Microsoft Azure.

Open the Visual Studio Solution of your bot.

Next, right click in your bot project and click on "__Publish__".
