# Module 1 - Bot Framework Basics

Welcome to Module 0, in this section you will create your first bot application and learn the basic structure of the project.

:sos: Before we start, I strongly suggest you make sure you downloaded all the necesary software and files needed specified in [Module 0](https://github.com/DanyStinson/BigBotTheory/tree/master/Modules/Module-0)

The first step, as you will imagine is to **Open Visual Studio**.

After that, create a new project, select the Bot Application template. Assign your project a name and give life to your first bot! 

**Note**: Check the "Add to Source Control" option, it will help with you with version control and you will have a repository to work with.
